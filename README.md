# Take payments IRL with Solana Pay

### For Users

To use the app properly, please ensure you have a Solana wallet installed in your browser.
In this case, _Solflare_ appears to work the best at the moment, since _Phantom_ doesn't support partial signatures of transactions _yet_.

Once ready, go to
https://solana-pay-tutorial-eta.vercel.app/
and connect with your browser extension wallet.

You will be able to "purchase" two different options of cookie packages.
For each order, you will receive one _cookie token_ -- collect 5 and your next order will be 50% off.

### For Developers

fork repo and use
`npm install`
to install all dependencies.

Or you can start tutorial yourself from scratch at
https://www.pointer.gg/tutorials/solana-pay-irl-payments/

Then, to begin local deployment of app, run
`npm run dev`
